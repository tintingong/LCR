    "In our previous session, we learned that linear regression aims to find the line of best fit, which is the line that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed data points and the predicted values. This process works well when there is a clear linear relationship between the predictor variable (independent variable) and the response variable (dependent variable). However, linear regression will still attempt to fit a line even when the data is randomly scattered without a clear trend.\n",
